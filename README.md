# Innomatics_Hackathon
End-to-end food delivery data analysis using Python &amp; Pandas with multi-source data (CSV, JSON, SQL) merged into a single source-of-truth dataset.

# 📊 Food Delivery Data Analysis – Hackathon Project

This repository contains a complete data analysis project built as part of a hackathon / internship assignment.  
The project simulates a real-world food delivery platform by integrating data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, and SQL) into a single, clean dataset for analysis.

## 🔧 What Was Done

- Loaded and cleaned transactional, user, and restaurant data  
- Merged datasets using **LEFT JOINs** to create a single source of truth  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas  
- Answered key business questions related to:
  - Gold vs Regular user behavior
  - City-wise and cuisine-wise revenue performance
  - High-value users and restaurants
  - Seasonal and quarterly revenue trends  
- Generated insights that can support data-driven business decisions
